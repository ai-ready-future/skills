# readiness — what sofa needs in this repository

Read-only. Change no file.

1. Run the check script from the main folder of the repository:

   ```
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/readiness.py --json
   ```

   It prints 1 JSON object per item: `id`, `area`, `status` (`ok`, `missing`, `wrong`, `unknown`), `blocks_start` (true or false), `detail`, and `fix` (the exact command, or the skill that fixes it).

2. Check the items that a script cannot judge, and add them to the table:
   - `claude-md-current`: read the root `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`). Is the build, test and run information in it still true for the repository? `wrong` if a command in it fails or names a file that does not exist.
   - `prompts-fit`: are the repository prompts (`CLAUDE.md` files, `.claude/skills`, `.claude/agents`, `.claude/rules`) short and specific? Only note it; `sofa:maturity` scores it.

3. Show the result as a table, grouped by area, `missing` and `wrong` first:

   | Area | Item | Status | Fix |
   |---|---|---|---|

   Under the table, list the items that block the start of the team. End with: run `/sofa:setup` to fix the items 1 at a time.

## The items

The script checks these. The source of truth is `scripts/readiness.py`; this list is for the reader.

- **Claude Code:** `--bg` and `--autocompact` exist; `autoCompactEnabled` is not `false`; a permission mode for unattended work is set (`/auto-mode-setup` or `bypassPermissions`); the advisor is on; the `outputStyle` names of the roles table exist.
- **Repository files:** root `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`; a `CLAUDE.md` router in each code folder (under 30 lines); `.claude/rules/` used for scoped rules (note only); `.gitignore` has `.sofa/`, `.env`, `node_modules`-style entries for the stack; `.git/info/exclude` has `.sofa/`; project `verify` and `simplify` skills, or `CLAUDE.md` names how to verify.
- **Brains:** `.claude/knowledge.json` lists `knowledge`, `adr`, `system-design`, `ddd`, `prd`, `roadmap`; the PRD and the roadmap exist (blocks start); ADR folder; domain model.
- **Plugins and skills:** each plugin and skill that the roles table names is installed (`claude plugin list`, `~/.claude/skills`); `gh` logged in (blocks start); `npx ctx7` runs.
- **Tools per role:** each value of section 1 "Tools per role" is set, and its CLI is on the PATH (`semgrep`, `gitleaks`, linters).
- **Human loop:** Slack value set, and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in the environment when it is not `none`; the `knowledge` brain has a human team page.
- **Team:** `docs/adlc.md` exists and has the current `sofa-template-version` (blocks start); the scheduler cron line exists; the state store opens.
