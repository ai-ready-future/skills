# sofa — software factory

This session is the launcher. It checks that the repository is ready, makes sure that `docs/adlc.md` meets the current template, and starts the orchestrator as a background session. The orchestrator starts the other roles.

## Files of the plugin

The skill folder is the root of the `sofa` plugin: two folders up from this file (`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../..`). Find its absolute path once and use it as `<skill folder>`.

- `templates/ADLC.md` — the current team definition. Each repository has its own copy in `docs/adlc.md`.
- `templates/MIGRATION.md` — how an older `docs/adlc.md` maps to the current template.
- `references/roles/<role>.md` — the work of each role. Sessions read these files from the installed plugin, so a fix here reaches each repository.
- `references/assessor.md` — the assessor of decision-judge.
- `skills/station/` — the base behavior of every session.
- `skills/readiness/`, `skills/setup/`, `skills/maturity/` — check, fix and score the repository.
- `commands/` — `/sofa:status`, `/sofa:request`, `/sofa:pause`, `/sofa:resume`, `/sofa:handoff`, `/sofa:stop`.
- `scripts/dispatch.sh` — starts 1 session of 1 role from the roles table.
- `scripts/sofa-state` — the state store CLI (`.sofa/state.db`).
- `hooks/register.tsx` — the mod: role colours, state store hooks, and the dashboard pane.
- `<repo>/docs/adlc.md` and `<repo>/docs/adlc/roles/<role>.md` — the team of 1 repository. The retro changes them.

A change that all repositories need goes to `ai-ready-future/skills` as an issue, which the retro offers.

## Step 1 — Readiness

Run the `sofa:readiness` skill. If it reports a `missing` item that blocks the start (marked `blocks start`), tell the user to run `/sofa:setup` and stop. Other missing items go in the `DONE` report at the end, so the user can fix them later with `/sofa:setup`.

Find the machine values of this start. They go only in the start prompts, because they differ on each machine that shares `docs/adlc.md`:

- Main folder: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in the main checkout, not in a worktree.
- Skill folder: the absolute path of the plugin root.
- GitHub account: the active account of `gh auth status`.
- Launcher name: your session name, on the first line of `ListAgents`.

If the `CLAUDE.md` of the repository names a different process or harness for product work, ask the user which one wins before step 2.

## Step 2 — Make `docs/adlc.md` meet the current template

The result: `docs/adlc.md` and `docs/adlc/roles/` on `main` meet the current `templates/ADLC.md` and role files, and hold the values of this repository.

- If `docs/adlc.md` does not exist: tell the user to run `/sofa:setup`, which asks the setup questions and writes it. Stop.
- If its `sofa-template-version` is lower than the template: migrate it with `templates/MIGRATION.md`. The file already holds the answers of the setup questions; ask only for the new values that the migration lists (for example, risk appetite and tools per role). Before you land the migration, tell the user what it changes, and continue only after the user agrees, because each machine that runs the team shares this file. Land it on `main` with a worktree, a PR and a squash merge. If live sessions of an older team exist (`ListAgents`), stop them before step 3.
- If it meets the template: go to step 3.

## Step 3 — Start the orchestrator

1. Pull `main` in the main folder. Read `docs/adlc.md`. Make sure `.git/info/exclude` has the line `.sofa/`. Run `<skill folder>/scripts/sofa-state init` from the main folder.
2. If `ListAgents` shows a live session with the orchestrator name, tell the user that the team runs, and how to open it (item 5). Stop, because a second orchestrator starts a second team.
3. Write this start prompt to a temporary file, with the machine values of step 1, and start the orchestrator from the main folder with `<skill folder>/scripts/dispatch.sh --adlc docs/adlc.md --role orchestrator --prompt-file <file>`:

   ```
   You are the orchestrator of the <prefix> team. Load the skill sofa:station.
   Then read docs/adlc.md on main, and your role files: <skill folder>/references/roles/orchestrator.md,
   and docs/adlc/roles/orchestrator.md if it exists. Where they differ, the repository file wins.
   Do the role "orchestrator" as written there. Start with "At start".
   Machine values: main folder <main folder>, skill folder <skill folder>, GitHub account <gh account>.
   The launcher is <launcher name>. Send it a DONE message when all always sessions of the team are ready.
   ```

4. Wait for the `DONE` message from the orchestrator.
5. Tell the user how to work with the team:
   - `claude agents --cwd <main folder>` shows the sessions of this repository in their role colours. Open the orchestrator, hitl or requests from there, or with `claude attach <name>`.
   - `/sofa:status` opens the dashboard; `/sofa:request <text>` gives the team new work.
   - The readiness items that are still missing, and `/sofa:setup` to fix them.

   Then this session has no more work.
