# ADLC — Agent Development Life Cycle

<!-- sofa-template-version: 6 -->

This file defines the agent team for this repository.
The `sofa` skill reads this file to start the team.
Every session loads the `sofa:station` skill, reads this file on `main`, then its role files (section 3, "Role files").
The retro session is the only owner of this file and of `docs/adlc/roles/`.

## 1. Setup values

The `sofa:setup` skill fills these values. They are the same on each machine that starts the team.

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `<owner>/<repo>` |
| Board tool | `<GitHub Projects \| Linear \| Jira \| none>` |
| Team prefix | `<prefix>` (session names are `<prefix>-<role>[-n]`) |
| Orchestrator name | `<prefix>-orchestrator` |
| Risk appetite | `<mvp \| early customers \| established>` (section 4, "Decision tables") |
| Product docs | `docs/product/prd`, `docs/product/roadmap` |
| System design | `docs/product/system-design`, or `none` |
| ADR folder | `docs/adr`. The list of ADRs and their status is in `docs/adr/README.md` |
| Domain model | `docs/domain`, or `none` (the `ddd` brain) |
| Proofs folder | `docs/proofs` (prototypes that support a proof of concept) |
| Extra context files | `<paths that every session must read, or none>` |
| Build | `<the command that builds, checks and tests the product before a PR, and the services it needs>` |
| Run | `<how a verifier runs the product as a user: a terminal for a CLI, a browser (Playwright) for a web app>` |
| Environments | `<name: how to reach it, how to deploy, where the logs and metrics are; one line per environment, or none>` |
| Healthy window | `24h` (how long a feature must run as expected in production before `monitoring` sets it `released`) |
| Reference program | `<a program whose behavior is a source for inferred rows, with its pinned version, or none>` |
| Slack | `<channel name, or none>` (the token is in the environment, never in this file, because this file is in the repository) |

Tools per role. `built-in` means the role uses only the skills of its row.

| Tool of | Tool |
|---|---|
| tracker | `<gh \| jira \| linear \| files>` |
| security | `<built-in \| semgrep \| snyk \| ...>` |
| code-quality | `<built-in \| sonarqube \| ...>` |
| monitoring | `<built-in \| datadog \| grafana \| sentry \| ...>` |
| feedback | `<none \| slack channel \| issues label \| form>` |
| ux-quality | `<none \| sentry \| posthog>` |

Machine values are not in this file, because they are different on each machine. The `sofa` skill finds them when it starts the team, and each start prompt gives them (section 8):
- Main folder: the absolute path of the main checkout on this machine.
- Skill folder: the absolute path of the installed `sofa` plugin on this machine.
- GitHub account: the active `gh` account on this machine. Sessions commit, push and open PRs as this account.

Repository rules:
- `<rules for this repository only: secrets folders, data that must not leave the repo, who approves destructive actions, which source wins when sources differ>`
- The ADRs in the ADR folder win over the extra context files where they differ.

## 2. Rules for all sessions

The rules that are the same for all roles are in the `sofa:station` skill, which every session loads at start. Rules that are only in this file:

1. A story has the state `ready` only if all of these are true:
    - Its spec is merged on `main`.
    - Its feature is not blocked: each feature in its `blocked_by` list has the state `done` or `released`.
    - No open `ASK` blocks the story.

    If one of these is false, the story stays in `backlog`. A role that changes the state of a story or a feature checks this rule in the same PR.
    Exception: an `ANSWER` can set the stories of a blocked feature to `ready` (for example, "start now"). The `blocked_by` list stays. The `Plan` line in `log.md` names the `ANSWER`.
    When a feature gets the state `done`, the same PR sets to `ready` each story that waited only for this feature and has a merged spec.
2. States of a story: `backlog` → `ready` → `in progress` → `done` → `released`. `monitoring` sets `released` (section 4, "Release flow"). A feature is `released` when each of its stories is.
3. Each role writes only the files of its row in section 3, "Who writes which file".

## 3. Roles

Tier: `always` sessions start with the team and stay live. `on demand` sessions start when an item needs the role, and stop after 1 hour free (orchestrator role file). `cron` is a system cron job, not a session.

| chores | `on demand` | `yellow` | `claude-sonnet-5-5` | `medium` | `300k` | `Concise` | 1 | A manual step is necessary | station | Chore request | Checked state |

Compact at: the size of the context window at which the session compacts its conversation by itself (`--autocompact`, section 8). The value comes from the model: `400k` for Opus, `300k` for Sonnet, `200k` for Haiku. A new row, or a row that changes its model, takes the value of its model.

Output style: a built-in style of Claude Code, passed with `--settings '{"outputStyle":"<style>"}'`. The names are `Proactive`, `Concise`, `Explanatory` and `Learning`, case-sensitive.

Colour: the session colour that the built-in `/color` sets, from the session name (`<prefix>-<role>[-n]`), when the session starts. The names are `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`, `pink` and `cyan`.

### Role files

The work of each role is in `<skill folder>/references/roles/<role>.md` and, if it exists, `docs/adlc/roles/<role>.md` (the retro writes it). Where the two files differ, the repository role file wins. A role that is only in this repository has only a repository role file.

### Who writes which file

| File or brain | Writer |
|---|---|
| PRD, roadmap stories and features | planner |
| Specs | specifier |
| Story and feature metrics (`docs/adlc/metrics/` until the `product` plugin takes them), missing roadmap stories | plan-auditor |
| Board | tracker |
| `adr` brain (`docs/adr`) | architect |
| `system-design` brain, nested `CLAUDE.md` routers, `.claude/rules` | designer |
| `ddd` brain | business-domain |
| `knowledge` brain, veracity of every brain | scribe |
| `docs/adlc.md`, `docs/adlc/roles/` | retro |
| Product code | implementer |
| e2e tests | tester |
| State store (`.sofa/state.db`) | the mod hooks and `sofa-state` |

## 4. Flows

### Feature flow

```
roadmap (main)
  → orchestrator picks next ready feature
  → tracker claims it on the board (if another team claimed it, the orchestrator picks the next one)
  → specifier: spec PR (business-domain reviews the domain language) → merge
       a spec with an unknown → specifier asks researcher for existing proofs
       no proof exists → orchestrator coordinates a proof of concept (research or a prototype in docs/proofs/)
       architect, designer or researcher learn the result into their brain
  → stories get the state ready (rule 1)
  → orchestrator at once assigns the spec to a free implementer (or starts one)
  → implementer: code PR with the Proofs block → REVIEW
  → reviewer (code, Proofs block, autonomous decisions), verifier (functions, product line), security and code-quality, at the same time
       request changes → implementer fixes → the same roles again (max 3 rounds)
       after 3 rounds  → decision-judge → hitl ASK
  → merger: rebase if needed, squash merge → author runs `wrapup`
  → tester: e2e tests from the verifier scenarios → test PR → reviewer → merger
  → plan-auditor: story done, metrics in the state store
  → orchestrator: send SYNC to tracker if roadmap changed
```

### Release flow

```
feature done on main
  → operator deploys (or CI deploys), reports the environment and the time
  → monitoring watches the feature for the healthy window
       healthy → PR that sets the stories and the feature to released → plan-auditor writes the metrics in the frontmatter
       not healthy → troubleshooter → root cause → TASK to the orchestrator (implementer or operator)
       no metric to watch → 1 ASK to hitl
  → feedback and ux-quality propose a proof-of-intent score and improvements → hitl confirms → planner writes stories
```

### Decision flow

```
any role: BLOCKED · decision (with the result of knowledge:ask) → orchestrator
  → decision-judge: knowledge:ask in a fork, assessor subagent (level, confidence, reversibility, visibility), cross-check
       cell = decide → ANSWER to the orchestrator (line `decided by: decision-judge (...)`), decision in the state store, TASK to scribe
       cell = ask    → hitl: card → human → ANSWER → decision-judge validates the pages it used (scribe)
  → orchestrator sends the ANSWER to the role that asked, and to the planner or the architect when a rule or an ADR changes
  → hitl: daily digest of the autonomous decisions. A veto by number → ASK, and the pages lose veracity
```

### Decision tables

The assessor of `decision-judge` gives each question a **level** (`detail`, `middle`, `direction`) and a **confidence** (`high`, `medium`, `low`). A caution band selects the table. Points:

| Dimension | Points |
|---|---|
| Reversibility: reversible | 0 |
| Reversibility: hard to reverse (data shape, public API, migration, money, security, deletion) | 2 |
| Reversibility: irreversible | always ask, no table |
| Visibility: visible (a user or a tester sees the result at once) | 0 |
| Visibility: hidden (the result shows later, in some cases, or only in the data) | 1 |
| Stage of the feature: new | 0 |
| Stage of the feature: released | 1 |
| Risk appetite (section 1): `mvp` | 0 |
| Risk appetite: `early customers` | 1 |
| Risk appetite: `established` | 2 |

Band: 0–1 `relaxed`, 2–3 `normal`, 4 or more `strict`.

Relaxed:

| Level | High | Medium | Low |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detail | Decide | Decide | Decide |
| Middle | Decide | Decide | Ask |
| Direction | Decide | Ask | Ask |

Normal:

| Level | High | Medium | Low |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detail | Decide | Decide | Ask |
| Middle | Decide | Ask | Ask |
| Direction | Ask | Ask | Ask |

Strict:

| Level | High | Medium | Low |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detail | Decide | Ask | Ask |
| Middle | Ask | Ask | Ask |
| Direction | Ask | Ask | Ask |

A question with `priority: blocks later` at level `direction` is always `Ask`.

### Side flows

- Design question from any role → architect (ADR) or designer (system design).
- Domain question → business-domain.
- ADR finding from a reviewer → architect → decision flow (section 4, "ADR finding flow").
- Rule question from the specifier → decision flow. A `revisit:` → planner or architect (section 4, "Ask the Rule").
- Gap in PRD or roadmap, or a new request → planner → PR → tracker `SYNC`.
- Manual step → chores.
- Study, bench, spike, measurement, or a search for existing proofs → researcher.
- Problem in an environment → troubleshooter.
- Command in an environment → operator.
- Security question → security.
- A new folder in a PR → designer (router).
- A new fact (an answer, a result, a retro outcome) → scribe.
- User changes a role → retro.
- Blocker from any role → orchestrator → chores (`user step`), decision-judge (`decision`) or the role that must act (`team`).

### ADR finding flow

```
reviewer: ADR finding → VERDICT: CHANGES → orchestrator
  → orchestrator: finding → architect (starts the architect if it is not running)
  → architect: verdict → orchestrator → reviewer and implementer
       no ADR change          → reviewer: new VERDICT for the PR
       contradicts ADR-NNNN   → BLOCKED · decision (change the code | change the ADR | deviate)
       needs an ADR           → BLOCKED · decision (accept the decision | change the code)
  → decision flow → ANSWER
  → architect: ADR PR (status proposed) if the ANSWER changes an ADR, adds one, or deviates (`deviates_from`) → merge
  → implementer: code fix if the ANSWER says so
  → reviewer and verifier: new check of the code PR
```

- The orchestrator gives the question the priority `blocks code now`.
- The implementer does not change the code for an ADR finding before the `ANSWER`. An ADR finding and its new check are not one of the 3 review rounds.
- The code PR does not merge until the `ANSWER` is in, the ADR PR (if there is one) is merged, and the reviewer and the verifier approve the last code.
- On the ADR PR of the architect, the reviewer checks that the ADR names the `ANSWER`.
- An ADR finding from a review is an exception to any rule that says "write the ADR now and do not stop to ask".

### Ask the Rule

The specifier asks for the rule, not for the value. A spec meets these conditions:

1. A rule card asks about 1 rule. Its answer decides 2 or more open rows, changes a PRD decision or an ADR, or decides a thing that is hard to undo. Hard to undo: a done feature, a public option, released behavior, public data, money. The answer of a card does not depend on another card in the same batch. No card asks about a row that `main` decides at the time that you send the card.
2. Each rule card has the block `This answer decides:` with at most 5 lines, in plain words. 1 line can name a group of rows. The lines name each PRD decision and each ADR that changes, each done feature that changes, and each public option that goes away or changes.
3. Round 1: at most 2 rule cards. A priority question that changes the order of features or a `blocked_by` link goes in the same batch, with the line `owner: planner`. The batch has at most 4 cards. Round 2: at most 2 cards, only for rows that stay open. There is no round 3. After round 2, each open row gets the recommended option with the source `default after round cap`, and the PR body names the row. If that row is hard to undo, send `BLOCKED` with the cause.
4. A rule answer is 1 row with the source `human:<login>, <date>` or `decision-judge:<D-id>, <date>`. Each row that follows from it has the confidence `inferred`, the source `derived from row <n>`, and a place in the Assumptions list.
5. Each other inferred row has the option that you would mark `[recommended]` and 1 source that a reviewer can open. The sources, from strong to weak: an accepted ADR, a PRD decision page, a `decided` area of the system design, a page of the `ddd` or `knowledge` brain with high veracity, a row of a built spec, the behavior of the reference program of section 1 at its pinned version, a line of the current code. A weak source does not count if a stronger source disagrees. A row with no source stays open.
6. The body of the spec PR lists the inferred rows with their sources, the stories that need no build, and the spec groups.
7. The owner of the page decides a change to an accepted ADR or a PRD decision that no card named. Send a `BLOCKED · decision` with the line `revisit: <page>`, the row, and the change that you recommend. A `revisit:` of an ADR goes to the architect; a `revisit:` of a PRD decision goes to the planner.

The ADR of a rule: `product:specifying-stories` writes 1 ADR with `status: proposed` for each rule row that binds code outside the stories of the feature, and no ADR for a derived row. The `ANSWER` of the rule card is the card that accepts that ADR (see the architect).

## 5. Message format

The first line of each message is the header:

```
<TYPE> · <from> → <to> · <subject id>
```

Types:

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TASK` | Do this work. From a role to the orchestrator: a suggestion of work for another role |
| `DONE` | Work is complete. Give links (PR, file) |
| `REVIEW` | PR is ready for review, or a review result (`VERDICT: APPROVE` or `VERDICT: CHANGES`, then `Role: <role>`) |
| `ASK` | A question for a human. Give the facts for the card |
| `ANSWER` | The answer to an `ASK` or to a `BLOCKED · decision`. From decision-judge it has the line `decided by:` |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot continue. Give the cause, where the work is, and 1 tag: `user step`, `decision` or `team` |
| `STATUS` | From the orchestrator: give your state. As a reply: 1 line with what you do now and the next step |
| `SYNC` | Copy `main` to the board |
| `RETRO` | User wants a team change |
| `RELOAD` | `docs/adlc.md` or a role file changed. Read them again |
| `PAUSE` | From the orchestrator: finish the turn, push the branch, send `STATUS`, then idle. With `now`: stop at once |
| `RESUME` | From the orchestrator: continue the open item from the branch |

## 6. Retro fast path

1. Make a worktree from `origin/main`.
2. Change only `docs/adlc.md` and the files in `docs/adlc/roles/`.
3. Open a PR. Send `REVIEW` to the orchestrator. A reviewer checks it as a document PR. After the approval, the merger merges it with squash.
4. Run `wrapup`.
5. Send `DONE` to the orchestrator. The orchestrator sends `RELOAD` to all sessions.

## 7. HITL card

Always use this layout, in this order:

1. The header: `from <role> → "<title>"`. The title tells the topic of the question in a few plain words.
2. The related line: `Related: <background in plain words>`. Write it only when there is useful background.
3. The question, in 1 sentence.
4. The decides block, for a rule card only (section 4, "Ask the Rule"): the line `This answer decides:` and at most 5 lines below it.
5. The options list: 1 bullet for each option, with the pros and the cons indented below it.
6. For a card that `decision-judge` escalated: the line `Judge: <level>, <confidence>, <reversibility>, <visibility>, band <band>` and its recommended option.

Example (markdown source):

```markdown
from specifier → "The label for standard input"

Related: A search needs a path until the team adds search of standard input.

What do we build now for the "(standard input)" label?

- **Only the output code:** a result can come from a file or from standard input, and standard input prints "(standard input)". A unit test checks it. The end-to-end test comes later. [recommended]
  - **Pros:** ✅
    - This work stays small
    - The standard input code is not written 2 times
  - **Cons:** ❌
    - Only the later end-to-end test fully proves the label
- **The full standard input search now:** read standard input and print the label, with an end-to-end test.
  - **Pros:** ✅
    - The label is fully proven now
  - **Cons:** ❌
    - This work gets much larger
```

Rules:
- Plain words: Write the header, the related line, the question and the options in plain English. Do not use IDs of features, stories, decisions, constraints or criteria. Say what the item does in plain words.
- Question IDs: Hitl keeps the question ID for itself. It uses the ID in the `ANSWER` message, but not in the card.
- Options: Start each option with a short bold name and a colon, then the description, with no number in front. Do not use tables, because tables do not show correctly on a mobile screen or in Slack.
- Recommended option: Put the text `[recommended]` at the end of the option. This is the only place of the recommendation.
- Pros and cons: Write `**Pros:** ✅` and `**Cons:** ❌`. Give each option 1 or more pros and 1 or more cons, each on its own indented bullet.
- Emojis: Use only ✅ and ❌, and only on the Pros and Cons lines.
- Number of options: Use 2 or 3 options.
- `AskUserQuestion`: Use the short bold name of each option as its label. In Slack, the card is the top message of a thread, and the options are the bullets.

## 8. Start commands

The `sofa` skill starts the orchestrator. The orchestrator starts each other session with the dispatch script of the plugin, from the main folder of this machine:

```
<skill folder>/scripts/dispatch.sh --adlc docs/adlc.md --role <role> [--n <n>] --prompt-file <file> [--resume <session id>]
```

The script reads the row of the role in section 3 and runs:

```
claude --bg -n <prefix>-<role>[-n] --model <model> [--effort <effort>] --autocompact <compact at> --settings '{"outputStyle":"<output style>"}' --permission-mode bypassPermissions "<start prompt>"
```

It prints the session id and the name. The orchestrator gives each session a name that no other session of this repository has, live or stopped (`claude agents --json --all`). The first session of a role has no number. The next sessions take the lowest free number, from `-2`. A session that the orchestrator deleted (`claude rm`) is not in that list, so its number is free again.

A live session does not change its colour, model, effort, compact value or output style after `RELOAD`. If section 3 changes one of them, restart each session of that role when it has no work.

If a session stops before its item is done, the `scheduler` (system cron, `bg-watch check`) restarts it and sends it `retry`. If the orchestrator finds a stopped session with an open item that the scheduler did not restart in 15 minutes, it resumes it with the dispatch script and `--resume <session id>` and the prompt `You were resumed. Continue your open item.` If the resume fails, it starts a new session.

Start prompt:

```
You are the <role> of the <prefix> team. Load the skill sofa:station and do what it says at start.
Your role files: <skill folder>/references/roles/<role>.md, and docs/adlc/roles/<role>.md if it exists.
The orchestrator is <orchestrator name>.
